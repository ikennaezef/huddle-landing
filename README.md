- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I recently just learnt about Styled Components and so this project was basically me practicing the use of styled components. It is a quite effective way of writing styles and it helps keep your files organised. I hope to keep on using it with ReactJS.
